A system of automatic indexing based on Baye's theorem is described briefly.. In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of agreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87 per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case.. The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn from nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the other.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis of subject content.. A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the technique indicated..
