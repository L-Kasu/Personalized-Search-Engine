An experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions.  The results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination.
