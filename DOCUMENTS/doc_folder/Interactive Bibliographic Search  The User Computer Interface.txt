On the 14th and 15th of January, 1971, a Workshop on The User Interface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases was held at Ricky's Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California.  The Workshop, sponsored by the Information Systems committee of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, brought together a group of information scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They were provided in advance with a Challenge paper and with a number of papers prepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselves were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user interface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted making the substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience. This book is intended to accomplish that goal.
