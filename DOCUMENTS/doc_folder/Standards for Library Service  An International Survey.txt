In recent years, it has become recognized that a country's documentation and library services, indispensable for all forms of economic, social and cultural development, should be considered as one co-ordinated information system and accordingly included in any national development plans.  However, planning can only be carried out if the necessary statistical data and other information are available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 with the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for a survey of standards for library services currently recommended for libraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrusted to F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of North London School of Librarianship (United Kingdom).
