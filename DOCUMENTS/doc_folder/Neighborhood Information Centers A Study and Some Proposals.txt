Our point of departure is a study of the feasibility and desirability of adapting the British Citizens' Advice Bureau (CAB) plan to the United States, carried out with the financial support and cooperation of the Ford Foundation. We conclude that the British CAB pattern, while creative, richly implicative and a major source of valuable guidance, if merely duplicated would not make the optimum contribution to the current American scene. We find overwhelming evidence that new information, advice, referral provision are necessary.  Localities need and want Neighborhood Information Centers (NIC's). We find promising beginnings and a number of attractive possibilities emerging out of the somewhat different efforts by a number of federal agencies, local government and local voluntary groups.  However, no one of these provides auspices for all the needed functions in accord with qualities which we find to be essential.
