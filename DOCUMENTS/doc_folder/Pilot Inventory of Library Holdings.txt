This project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books.  The findings of this study gave the Ohio State University libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest.  These figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books.  The areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use.
