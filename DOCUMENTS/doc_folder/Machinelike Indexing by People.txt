A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a large proportion of the title entries contained words identical to or synonymous with words of the corresponding subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine procedure operating on titles alone, provided the machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary.
