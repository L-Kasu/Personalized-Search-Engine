This article reports the results of survey of literature on measures of library effectiveness.. This survey led to the formulation of six criterion concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not been considered at all..
