Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin, the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an article on the use of the "typewriting machine" in cataloging.  Telephones have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books. Nevertheless, when the term "machine methods" is used for libraries today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.
