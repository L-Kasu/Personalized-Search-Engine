The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval of information in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely the potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing information needs.  In the belief that a discussion of the latter may be of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review of investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here. Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements. Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes  to demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local situations the general use of books and journals.
