The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us a theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific information and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systems philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles  by ordering the formerly random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and philosophy. This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the present Introduction to systems philosophy over a period of three years of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.
