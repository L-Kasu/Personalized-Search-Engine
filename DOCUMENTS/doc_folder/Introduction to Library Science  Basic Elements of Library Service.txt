Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as an institution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement of society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of which he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit in them.
