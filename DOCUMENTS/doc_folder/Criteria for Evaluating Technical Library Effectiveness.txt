In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three phases aimed at: I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating libraries developed up to the present. II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already published, or from any other sources, by which to develop criteria. III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria. Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings of the study.
