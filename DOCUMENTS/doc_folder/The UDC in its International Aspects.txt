Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world.
