The findings are described of a study aimed at determining the prospects and methods for improving the system of current bibliographic information..  The analysis has shown that the existing criteria for evaluation of special bibliographies (scope, coverage, arrangement, speed of announcement, etc.) are inadequate for an unbiased characterization of their exhaustivity and subject contents..  This hampers a correct choice of the sources of secondary information and leads to duplication, parallelisms and loss of information.. Judgements of the leading Soviet and foreign bibliographers relating to the problems under consideration are reviewed, which are all essentially in favor of a reconstruction of the publishing processes, issuing of scientific publications on a world scale, and algorithmization of the information processes..  It is suggested that the first objective of research should be a method of comparative evaluation of periodicals..
