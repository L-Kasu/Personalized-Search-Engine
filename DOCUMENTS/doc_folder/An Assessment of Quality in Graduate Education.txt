Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberation was given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship of an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that comprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There was never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted, concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's aegis was a suitable one.
