The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly, the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey. The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI. Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases. Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and 41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75 that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations.  The use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation.
