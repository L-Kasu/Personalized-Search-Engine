A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base utilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been developed for information retrieval organizations.. The model developed is y = b( 1 - e(  -at) ) where y is the number of users of a data base at time t, and a and b are parameters to be estimated.. Illustrations of the model applied to a typical information retrieval organization are given and discussed..
