This paper presents a rapid and efficient generalized minicomputer text searching system.. The system has been applied to Chemical Condensates and enjoys search speeds comparable to services operating on large computer systems.. Complete Boolean algebraic search strategy expressions may be used as direct entries, and all forms of transaction are automatically processed.. Benchmark search speeds and results are presented for realistic profiles serving varied research groups in a major university chemistry department..
