Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1) scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization).. Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network structures..
