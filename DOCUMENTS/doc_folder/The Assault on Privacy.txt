The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call I received during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G. Miller, then Director of the University of Michigan's Mental Health Institute and currently Vice President for Academic Affairs of Cleveland State University.  He asked what I am sure he thought was a relatively straightforward and easily answered question:  What are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials? On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploring the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national, multi-media information network, that would electronically integrate our colleges and universities, eventually providing each of them a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and educational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life into this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM).
