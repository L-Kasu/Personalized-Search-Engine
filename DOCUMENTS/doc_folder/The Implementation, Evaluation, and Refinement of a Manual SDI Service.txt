The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive, manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire to continue participation in the service..
