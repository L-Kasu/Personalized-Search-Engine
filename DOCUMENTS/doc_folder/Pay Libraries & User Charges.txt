The battle lines are being drawn for a great debate over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library and information services are to be funded in the coming decades. Most librarians will be on the side of conservatism and democracy, favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported public library service with information freely available to all as a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers, government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will be on the side of progress and profits, advocating a new concept of for-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable commodity.
