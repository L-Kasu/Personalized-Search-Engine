Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those who seem to know all about this thing called "OCLC" and who keep popping that rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence, and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress? Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow - is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes, but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books were unchained from the shelves.
