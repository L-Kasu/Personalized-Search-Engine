The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at a time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were expanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the company were directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests that were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake. Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as employees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC has had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management was enthusiastic in its support of the new project.
