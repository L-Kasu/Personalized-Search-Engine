The present study attempted to extend previous work on bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals in the following ways: (1) by selecting for study those journals to which American sociologists prefer to submit their work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, all bibliographical references (journals, books, technical reports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison, a journal from the physical sciences.  Such a study, it was hoped, would yield data concerning similarities and differences among the sociological journals and between the sociological journals and the physical science journal.
