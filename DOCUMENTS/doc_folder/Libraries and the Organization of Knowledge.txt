From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a professional activity enters a new stage.  This usually takes place as the culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates. Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward. This is what Dean Jesse H. Shera has set out to do in this collection of his essays and addresses.
