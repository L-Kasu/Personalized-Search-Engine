There are some who question whether the status of women in the library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature, however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns and other professional situations. There are local library groups which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state and national level, conference programs and workshops at library association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's materials and the like.
