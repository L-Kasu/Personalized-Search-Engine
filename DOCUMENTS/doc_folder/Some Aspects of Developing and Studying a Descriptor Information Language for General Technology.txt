The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes   analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing..
