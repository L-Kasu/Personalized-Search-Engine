I am going to describe in general terms a research project which has been established to explore some of the problems of the use of the literature, particularly in the field of Biomedical Engineering of the National Institute for Medical Research (Hampstead Laboratories).  The project is scheduled to last for three years, and like most research, consists of a number of overlapping stages.  We have reached the stage now of having acquired sufficient equipment and data to start trying out some of our ideas.
