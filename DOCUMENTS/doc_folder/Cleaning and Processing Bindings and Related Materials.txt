The destructive effects of air pollution in the modern city upon the health of its people, its trees, and its gardens, even its buildings and statues, are well known and are being increasingly fought against.  But the public, generally, and even many librarians and book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unaware of the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under these conditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades the books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than 90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately, even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem, they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert advice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries. The present essay is intended to meet this need.
