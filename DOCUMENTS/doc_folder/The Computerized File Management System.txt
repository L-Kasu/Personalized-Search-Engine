A file management system can provide a powerful search tool for a library reference group.  The system described produces both current awareness and retrospective searches from several diverse data bases.  The same query language can be used to interrogate all data bases in either on-line or batch mode. Searches can be made for any word, word root, phrase, or number in any part of any entry.  Citations selected by coordination of terms can be either printed or used to custom-make new machine-readable files.  Costs are reasonable; an average batch mode search requires 11 seconds of CDC 6600 time.
