This volume presents the results of a detailed study of the place of foreign language materials in University research. In the course of our investigation, we accumulated a large amount of data on the use of published information and of library services by research workers and academic staff.  Our analyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims of the project, but we have been constantly aware that there are many other possible analyses of the same material.  For this reason we have endeavoured to include in the Appendix as much of this raw data as possible and to provide in the text itself, when presenting our own analyses, as much detail as possible of the methodology and other background information necessary for any full evaluation.
