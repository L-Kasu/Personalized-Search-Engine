This paper develops a conception of ways in which certain psychosocial processes affect the allocation of rewards to scientists for their contributions - an allocation which in turn affects the flow of ideas and findings through the communication networks of science.  The conception is based upon an analysis of the composite of experience reported in Harriet Zuckerman's interviews with Nobel laureates in the United States (1) and upon data drawn from the diaries, letters, notebooks, scientific papers, and biographies of other scientists.
