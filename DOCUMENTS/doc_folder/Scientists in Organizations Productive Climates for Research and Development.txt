This book is addressed to scientists and engineers, to administrators of research and development, and to all others who are concerned about the effects of organizations upon the work of their members.  This book is one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike many previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide range of research personnel. Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of laboratories.
