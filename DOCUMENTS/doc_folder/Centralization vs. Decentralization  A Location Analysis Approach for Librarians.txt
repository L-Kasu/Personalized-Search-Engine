An application of location theory to the question of centralized versus decentralized library facilities for a university, with relevance for special libraries is presented.  Locating university libraries near classrooms, offices, and dormitories requires a larger budget than combining these libraries into a centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost to the university community which does not appear in the university budget - a cost in time, energy, and decreased use resulting from locating the library a longer distance from users.  The analysis provides models for a single library, for two or more libraries, or for decentralized facilities.
