Carl Hastings Milam spent the most productive years of his life in the positions with which his name is most closely associated, those of secretary and, later, executive secretary of the American Library Association (ALA) from 1920 to 1948.  When he became secretary, the association had already been in existence for forty- four years.  What kind of association was it that claimed Milam's allegiance? What experience had he had with ALA before becoming its secretary?  The answers to these questions lead to better understanding of Milam, the association, and their close relationship.
