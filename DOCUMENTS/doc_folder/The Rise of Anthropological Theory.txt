My main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man.  There is an urgency associated with this rededication, which grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international development programs.  A general theory of history is required if the expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned journals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues.
