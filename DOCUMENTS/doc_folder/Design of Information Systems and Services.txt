This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters. The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows: 1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and the relationship to information science. 2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as applied to the analysis and design of information systems. 3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document storage and retrieval systems.
