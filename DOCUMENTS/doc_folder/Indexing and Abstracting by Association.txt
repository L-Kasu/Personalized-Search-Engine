This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers; several means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore "associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching.
