The preface to the first edition of this book - which is reproduced following this - shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in it were felt to be controversial, needing to be championed.  A few years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent, for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search, has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion.
