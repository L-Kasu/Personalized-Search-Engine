One of the objectives of a library catalog is to enable one to determine what books or publications by an author are in the library.. Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of corporate and personal authorship..
