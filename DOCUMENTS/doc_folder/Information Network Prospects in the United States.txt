Unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward the creation sometime soon of a national information network in the United States.  The concept of a national network implies the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries through communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of this nation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and research resources to be found in its libraries and information centers. Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resources will remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But if maximum communication can be established among them, this array can be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens throughout the country.
