The marriage between the University of Michigan Library and Community Systems Foundation seemed like a sensible step at the time.  Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose between alternate courses of action without having adequate information. In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a consequence of this situation, the library administrators were considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could be designed and properly evaluated.
