This paper describes a document retrieval system implemented with a subset of the medical literature.. With the exception of the development of a negative dictionary, all system operations are completely automatic.. Introduced are methods for computation of term-term association factors, indexing, assignment of term-document relevance values, and computations for recall and relevance.. High weights are provided for low-frequency terms, and retrieval is performed directly from highly connected term-document files without elaboration.. Recall and relevance are based on quantitative internal system computations, and results are compared with user evaluations..
