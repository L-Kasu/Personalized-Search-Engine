There are many useful computer-readable data bases that are accessible only to major governmental units, universities, or industrial organizations. An experiment is described in which the public library is used as a linking agent between the public and such data bases. Retrieval terminals have been placed  in four public libraries in Northern California to provide access to sixteen different data bases.  The first year of this two-year experiment is described, and some of the technical, organizational, and economic aspects of the study are reviewed. Rapid acceptance of the system during this initial no-cost period has been achieved and  useful evaluative data have been obtained.
