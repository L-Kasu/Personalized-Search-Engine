The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others from making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a constitutionally recognized goal - To promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts - Congress has thus adopted a constitutionally authorized means - securing...to Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries.
