The problem of determining the optimal cross-reference structure for a given index and for a given community of users is discussed.. A ross-reference structure is represented as a graph in which the nodes are index terms and the links are relations between index terms.. In order to clarify the concept of 'level of cross-referencing' the characteristics of cross-referencing structure are studied.. Some measures of cross-reference distributions are suggested as a means of comparing the cross-referencing levels of subject indexes.. Types of relations linking the terms of cross-references in existing indexes and thesauri are examined.. The implications of the study for the construction and testing on indexes and thesauri are discussed..
