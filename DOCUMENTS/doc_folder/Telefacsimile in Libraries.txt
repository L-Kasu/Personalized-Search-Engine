The use of telefacsimile systems to provide rapid transfer of information has great appeal.  Because of a growing interest in the possible applicability of this technology to libraries, the Council on Library Resources provided a grant to the Institute of Library Research to conduct an experiment using telefacsimile equipment in a working library situation.  The study was designed to explore the feasibility of telefacsimile for present interlibrary use.  It provides information on the performance, cost, and utility of telefacsimile systems for libraries.
