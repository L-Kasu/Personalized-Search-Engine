This book originally set out to be a kind of reporting-in-depth of the American Library Association Pre-Conference on Acquisitions held in Atlantic City in the summer of 1969 - a report embracing not only the essential content of the formal speeches, but also the floor discussions and after-hours bull sessions. Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem of how to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up and was published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing Library Materials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D. Veilette. A treatment of the acquisition process in college and university libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January 1970 issue of Library Trends.  The acquisition problems of research libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual International Seminars on Approval and Gathering Plans in Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, sponsored by Western Michigan University in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969.
