This work describes a conceptual design of an automated national library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it is intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than provide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns an automated national library system but does not attempt to automate all parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions of bibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  If these functions can be economically automated, the major problems associated with our information explosion will be solved.
