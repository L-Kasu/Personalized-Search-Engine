In the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological disciplines, it has become obvious to us that in their communication activities, some disciplines behave quite differently from others.. Recently, we have reanalyzed our data for the physical, the engineering, and the social sciences.. We do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups, so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences.. We have included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however, so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups.. Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact, make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible.. We will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science..
