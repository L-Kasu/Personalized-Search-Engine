(I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred ("answer-providing documents").. "Answer can be inferred from document" has many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an "inference specification").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is "nonrelational", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..
