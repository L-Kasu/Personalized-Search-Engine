When is a librarian's decision not to include a book in his library collection an act of book selection, and when is it censorship?  Is there, in fact, any discernible difference in the two terms: book selection and censorship?  This topic was discussed so lucidly and ably, long ago, by Lester Asheim in what has become a classic essay in the literature of librarianship, "Not Censorship, but Selection," that raising it again may appear to be an exercise in redundancy.
