This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled "Use of Machine- Readable Data Bases."  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy (153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier data base papers not treated in prior chapters. For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic or document-related data.
