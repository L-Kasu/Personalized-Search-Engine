In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed by the Canadian National Science Library, completed its first year of operation.  At that time the project, designed as a national service to alert scientists and technologists to current information in specific fields of research, was serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers requiring a total of more than three thousand five hundred individual computer queries.  Over one thousand personalized bibliographies are prepared each week from commercially available data bases purchased from Chemical Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and the British Institution of Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of the service was given in a paper by J.E. Brown published in October 1969.
