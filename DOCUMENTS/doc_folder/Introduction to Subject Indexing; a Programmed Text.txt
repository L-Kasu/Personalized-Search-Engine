This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out under a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information (now the British Library Research and Development Department).  The project, designed to investigate the applicability of the techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject indexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnic of North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales. The programmed instruction course, written during this project and used by students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of the programmed text. Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Our intention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course of programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular system.
