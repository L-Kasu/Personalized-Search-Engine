The authors challenge accepted doctrine which asserts that the adequacy of an academic library cannot be measured by the number of books which it contains.. Out of their feeling that the Standards for College Libraries and the Standards for Junior College Libraries are inadequate for estimating the size (in volumes) required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of higher education of widely differing characteristics, they developed new formulas for this purpose.. These formulas attempt to identify the principal factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further research in needed.. They end by suggesting specific topics for such research..
