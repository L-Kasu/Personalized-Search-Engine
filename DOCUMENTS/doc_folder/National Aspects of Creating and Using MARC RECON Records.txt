Concurrently with the RECON Pilot Project, the RECON working Task Force undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation that are of national scope. First, is it feasible to define a level or subset of the MARC format that would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national network  Second, is it possible to use machine-readable records from a variety of sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion effort on the national level  Third, what are the problems of producing a National Union Catalog from machine-readable records  As these studies and the pilot project progressed, it also became apparent that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a large-scale conversion project.  Therefore, it seemed essential to investigate alternative strategies for RECON that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short time span.
