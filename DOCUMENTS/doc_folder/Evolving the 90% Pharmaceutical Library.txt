The growing need for library space dictated a quantitative study to ascertain user requirements.  A monitoring operation has been established whereby data are continuously collected on the use made of periodicals shelved in a restricted storage area.  The data, obtained from photocopy request forms, identify the core collection of journals which satisfies 90% of our library research requirements.
