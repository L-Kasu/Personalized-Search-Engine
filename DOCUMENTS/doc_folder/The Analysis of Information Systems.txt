This book is intended to supply the background needed for participation in the analysis and design of information-handling systems and for understanding the literature in the field. I have tried to present a unified approach to the subject and to the relation of information retrieval to other disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this interdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientist or computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrieval problems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.
