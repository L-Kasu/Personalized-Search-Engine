The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information systems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the satisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise planning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication.  While "user studies" have not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research has witnessed progress along the following lines: Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in this field earlier in less rigorous forms; The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution development records; comparison of research teams working on identical tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; and An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research in this area.
