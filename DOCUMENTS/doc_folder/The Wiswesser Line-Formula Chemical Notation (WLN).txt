The line-formula chemical notation described in this manual is a precise and concise means of expressing the structural formulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to use letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings. These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of the molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever since structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic symbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply an extension and standardization of this practice.
