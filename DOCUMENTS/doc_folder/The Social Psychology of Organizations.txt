In our attempts to extend the description and explanation of organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal relations to system constructs.  The interdependent behavior of many people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate collective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand, furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.
