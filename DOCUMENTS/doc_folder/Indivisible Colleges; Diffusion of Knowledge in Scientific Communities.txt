In the last two decades, dramatic increases in the scope and volume of scientific research have occurred, as may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific literature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price 1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular items of scientific information and for the documentation specialist who must make them readily available, the organization and management of this huge and expanding store of information is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal. Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.
