Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the methodology of "user" studies.

One never realizes how truly wrong this view is until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers.
