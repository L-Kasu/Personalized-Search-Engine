In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have improved the communication between librarians and the consumers of information on a national and international basis, and we have refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying information.  In addition, library education has been on the front line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of organizing and disseminating information of all types.
