This report and its recommendations are in response to the Commission's request for "a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in the library and information science field."  While it is offered as only the start of an on-going process of developing a nationwide program, its recommendations are the result of an intensive nine-month project, involving hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields. Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified.
