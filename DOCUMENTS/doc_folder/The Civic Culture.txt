We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themes of political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and its consequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democratic polity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, and upbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using survey research to study these classic themes, we are also following the traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to us for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville and Bryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat on the cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democratic attitudes.
