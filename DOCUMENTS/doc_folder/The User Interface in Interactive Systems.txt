The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing power is made available through interactive terminals to people who are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.
