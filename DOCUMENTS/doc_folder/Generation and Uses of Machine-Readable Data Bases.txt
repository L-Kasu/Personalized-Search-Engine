This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation.
