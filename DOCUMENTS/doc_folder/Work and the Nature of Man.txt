Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of a trilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book, Job Attitudes  Review of Research and Opinion, my colleagues and I attempted to review and systematize what had been gleaned from research and contemplation after a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to Work that followed, we described an original research study that offered a completely new hypothesis about the way people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have taken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory of Work and the Nature of Man.	While the trilogy contains the three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge of what has gone before, new research and finally a theory, the task that I set out for myself many years ago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning. That task was to give original substance to the new discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible, to make some positive contributions.
