Arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on information are phenomena, the principles of which provide the basis for a metascience of information  (informatology).. The fundamental character of the phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information- oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied, a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems for which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggested that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of information be developed and implemented..
