Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publications program, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic method of handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists and chemical engineers to meet their information needs. Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed record of chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely, special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanized match and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the varied needs of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever form best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable tapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer, or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files.
