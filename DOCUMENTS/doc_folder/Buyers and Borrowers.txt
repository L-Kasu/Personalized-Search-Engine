This is the second book based on studies into social aspects of book reading. The present book is largely a report on work which was carried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or written up in time for the first book, or work actually carried out and analysed during the second year's research.  The reader of this book will find it useful to have read the first book, but the present book is self-contained and does not require reference to the first one.
