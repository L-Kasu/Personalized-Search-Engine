During two one-week periods in April 1972, information on periodical title and date was gathered from  periodicals collected from study and reshelving tables of the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library. It was determined that  (1) a few titles accounted for most of the total use; (2) the relationship between age and amount of use of a journal may be described by the equation y = ke  (-bx); and (3) the last five years of publication accounted for 58% of the total use.
