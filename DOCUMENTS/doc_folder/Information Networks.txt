The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and used in our complex society has presented us with major problems in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio and television to the communications satellite, the methods of electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information to its ultimate users.
