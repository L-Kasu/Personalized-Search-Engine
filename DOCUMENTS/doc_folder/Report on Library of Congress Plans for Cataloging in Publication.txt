When we were asked in October 1969 for an expression of attitude about a renewal of cataloging-in-source, our response was positive. We were interested and we were determined to make it succeed.  Profiting from the experience gained in the 1958-59 experiment, we specified that  1. A survey of libraries be conducted; 2. a survey of publishers be conducted; 3. an expert investigator be secured; 4. there must be adequate funding; 5. there be adequate space; and, 6. that those factors be eliminated which represented the most crucial problem areas in the 1958-59 experiment.
