The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy for the '70's are presented.. These are   the performance of users' needs studies by the representative small group technique; the analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final design of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from earlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..
