The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical and experimental nature rather than on practical applications.  However, the articles selected are viewed as having a considerable potential in two major respects  they have important implications for the practice of information handling, but even more important, they contain aspects of generalization.  The book is oriented toward basic and experimental work, such as that performed by traditional sciences, with the hope that a reader may find much relevant to his own interests, educational level and background, a bridge toward generalizations, a feeling of interconnection between seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or found in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps in knowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions or further theoretical or experimental work.
