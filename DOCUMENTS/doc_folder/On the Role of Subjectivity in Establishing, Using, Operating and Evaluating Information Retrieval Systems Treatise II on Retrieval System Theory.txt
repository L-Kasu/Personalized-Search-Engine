The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search, particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the methods sufficient for his personal file.. The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of fundamental notions such as information and order.. This gives him a better understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently, even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more objective and formal.. Such a better mutual understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of scientific communication..
