In this book I have presented the tests according to the research design for which each is suited.  In discussing each test, I have attempted to indicate its function, i.e., to indicate the sort of data to which it is applicable, to convey some notion of the rationale of proof underlying the test, to explain its computation, to give examples of its application in behavioral scientific research, and to compare the test to its parametric equivalent, if any, and to any nonparametric tests of similar functions.
