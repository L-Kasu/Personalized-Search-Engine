In this article we examine the concept of the information user, and attempt to describe some of the dynamics of the situation by discussing some of our data relative to intraindividual variations (changes which occur within individual scientists as their scientific work progresses) and interindividual variations (physical vs social scientists, basic vs applied scientists, experienced vs inexperienced scientists, and scientists' working in the same subject-matter area vs scientists who recently changed their areas).. All of these were found to produce significant variation in the information needs of scientists and in the sources they used to satisfy these needs.. Some implications of these findings relative to information technology are discussed..
