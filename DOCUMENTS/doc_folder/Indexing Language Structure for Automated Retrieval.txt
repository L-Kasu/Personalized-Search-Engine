A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language is made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be built up by a form of learning process in the course of regular indexing.. The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, using the thesaurus-classification as a switching language, and for automatic classification, are suggested as long-term aims..
