Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific literature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree of similarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlier paper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other citation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science.
