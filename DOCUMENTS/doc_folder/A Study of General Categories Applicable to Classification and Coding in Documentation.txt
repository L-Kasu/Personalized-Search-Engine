The rapid development of information retrieval methods since the last war - together with the development of systems using mechanical or electromechanical means (punched cards) for such purposes followed later by electronic retrieval (computers) - have led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding systems for books and documents.  Generally speaking, document specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different codes, usually totally unrelated to each other, each conceived to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular organization.  This is farther than ever - at least to all appearances - from the original intention of 1895 of the founders of the Institut International de Bibliographie (now known as the Federation Internationale de Documentation), i.e., the standardization of classification methods.
