This book is designed primarily for use as a first-year graduate text in information theory, suitable for both engineers and mathematicians.  It is assumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and elementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random process theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder to meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity and capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory are quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory have made the major results more accessible than in the past.
