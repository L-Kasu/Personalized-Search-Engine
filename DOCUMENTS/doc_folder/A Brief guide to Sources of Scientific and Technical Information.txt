This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive content of a one-and-a-half day course which was given before three groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of 1967.  Its purpose was to train and inform working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient means of seeking and acquiring work-related information. The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms, and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional activities.
