The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Only now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly described. It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of what seem to be the most important aspects of each. Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States. Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful, that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging. I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.
