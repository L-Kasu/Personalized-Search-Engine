A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is described.. The system is characterized by the fact that several hundred different  methods are available to analyze  documents and search requests.. This feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of operations initially unspecified, and adapting the search strategy to the needs of individual users.. The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment, but also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods.. Results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information.. A typical search request is used as an example in the present  report to illustrate systems operations  and evaluation procedures..
