In the intervening years since the appearance of the first collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery, Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y., The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentrated on the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliary to the card catalog. This selection of papers has identified some of the efforts to solve particular problems concerned with book catalogs.  The published papers, as well as those which have been written specifically for this volume, bring additional observations concerning the place of the book catalog in library services.
