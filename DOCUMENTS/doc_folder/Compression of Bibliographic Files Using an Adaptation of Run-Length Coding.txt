Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from the application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The method involves attenuation of the zero one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero one ratios the most frequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form of run-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-length binary number is then applied..
