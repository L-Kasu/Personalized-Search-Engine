In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional and supporting areas.  Librarianship was not immune  there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower. It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought.
