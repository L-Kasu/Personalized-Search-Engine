The book is designed to serve multiple purposes.  First the needs of practicing librarians, particularly those who are just beginning their careers, and require a general guide and source of operational and bibliographic information, have been given special consideration.  A second purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and other advanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature of the life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons in management positions of organizations in which the establishment of a library is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents, the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource for library consultants engaged in assisting management to make the right decisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessed and endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements.
