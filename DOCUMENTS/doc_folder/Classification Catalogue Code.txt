The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues represent three successive stages in the order of evolution of the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classified form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue. Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal influence gained by its being taught to students of library science during the last twenty years. While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for their applicability.  They are all of general application, irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.
