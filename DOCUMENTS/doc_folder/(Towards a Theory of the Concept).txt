A concept is regarded as the common element of both classification systems and thesauri.  Reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings behind these tokens. A concept of, say, an object, a property of an object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject.  It is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts, which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems. Different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions (information statements) on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems.
