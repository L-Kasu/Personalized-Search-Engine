This book is about the business firm and the way it makes economic decisions.  We propose to make detailed observations of the procedures by which firms make decisions and to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision making within business organizations.  Our articles of faith are simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporary economic decision making, we need to supplement the study of market factors with an examination of the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of organizational structure and conventional practice on the development of goals, the formation of expectations, and the execution of choices.
