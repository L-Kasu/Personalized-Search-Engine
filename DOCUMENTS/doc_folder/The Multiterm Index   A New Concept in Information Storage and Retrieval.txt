An index not only can be a creative communication medium, it needs to be in a research and development environment.  A creative index is achievable if the relationship and association of things and actions, one to another, can be communicated as a continuous function vis-a-vis the real world of science and technology. A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example, ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely a word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It is a concept that he associates with or relates to a product, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a property, etc.  It is within the semantics of his conceptual needs that he would like to use an index to retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than documents, however, from the index.  He wants the index to direct him to those documents which are pertinent to his problem.  He wants the index to help him to generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations. He wants the index to help him in terms of his language, logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the ability to browse among the terms to discover the term that is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his memory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy if it is to be a creative medium of communication.
