Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptive or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimate the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a sample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use of probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive statistics  arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested, the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries (university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidence of the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as to indicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlations for significant factors.
