The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement has become increasingly apparent as more and more book catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog, or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer filing of complex alphabetic entries.
