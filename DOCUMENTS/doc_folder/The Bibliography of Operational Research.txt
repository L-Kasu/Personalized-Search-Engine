In his book on Documentation (1948) the librarian, S.C. Bradford, discussed certain regularities in the pattern of distribution of articles on a particular subject over different journals.  He gives as examples the distributions for geophysics from 1928-31 inclusive and lubrication for 1931 to June, 1933, inclusive.  The typical picture is one in which, to a bibliography covering a certain short term of years, a few journals contribute a large number of articles, more journals contribute fewer and so on in a monotonic sequence ending with a large number of journals contributing one article each.  Patterns of this kind have been observed by several authors, but Bradford was the first, I think, to advance an explanation of the effect in bibliographical terms.
