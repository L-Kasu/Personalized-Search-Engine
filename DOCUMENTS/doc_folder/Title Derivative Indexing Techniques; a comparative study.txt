The increasing volume of published literature continues to present problems in relation to information handling and information representation. As the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continued to increase, investigators have examined means of reducing the costly and time-consuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms to documents.  Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, and concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist in the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partly mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process has become more widespread.  Machine indexing is a process whereby mechanized or automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished.  The present study investigates one aspect of automatic computer-based indexing, the permuted title index.
