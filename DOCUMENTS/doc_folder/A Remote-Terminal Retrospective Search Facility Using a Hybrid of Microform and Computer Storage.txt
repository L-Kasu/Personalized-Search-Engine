This paper describes a technical document center providing remote-terminal retrospective search capability and shows its evolution from the traditional catalog card operation.. The system uses mini-computers for on-line input and editing of data and for production of announcements, and uses a commercial computer-utility  communication network for retrospective searching.. A hybrid of microform and computer storage was designed to decrease computer and line charges and to allow for security considerations.. Bilingual search capability in either of two models suitable for experienced users or novices is provided to a network of satellite libraries separated by as much as 3000 miles.. A Selective Dissemination of Information service is provided using in-house and foreign data bases and serving over 600 profiles of interest..
