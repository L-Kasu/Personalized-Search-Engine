Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode of the other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries or systems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readers tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context of a real library environment and against the background of particular institutional service objectives.
