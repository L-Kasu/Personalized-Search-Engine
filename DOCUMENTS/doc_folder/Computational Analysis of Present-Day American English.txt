Readers can expect to find many parts of this volume tantalizing.  The definiteness of the answers to certain questions irresistibly provokes more questions.  The happy feature is that the book provides information required to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of Present-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.  Accordingly, any reader who seriously wants answers to further questions can set about getting those answers.
