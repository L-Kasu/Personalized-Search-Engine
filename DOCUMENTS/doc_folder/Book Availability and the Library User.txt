The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library services.
