A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and record knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to satellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this purpose. The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented. Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment. Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions, develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.
