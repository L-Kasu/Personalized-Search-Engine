This article is concerned with the general theory of chemical synthesis and with the application of machine computation to the generation of chemical pathways for the synthesis of complicated organic molecules.  The basis for the approach which has been developed comes in large measure from the methods used by chemists in the solution of certain types of synthetic problems.
