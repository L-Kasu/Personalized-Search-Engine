Although it is hoped that this sourcebook will be of interest to those of any discipline concerned with new developments in science of the last quarter century, it is addressed principally to the student of human behavior as that study is approached from the social side.  This is so partly because that is the editor's main competence and interest, but primarily because the study of human behavior is the general area of science that has least responded to the exciting challenge of the modern systems outlook.  Yet it is precisely this general area that stands to gain the most from insights into the workings of the more complex types of systems.
