A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, have inculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of American library education.  They are personal opinions - no more - but they come from one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedly that the American spirit includes  a firm resolution to change whatever is inefficient or corrupt.  Otherwise, 1776 would have no meaning.  The opinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accredited schools in which I have taught, but are strongly rooted in my general observation of library education practice and my discussions with members of the library profession.
