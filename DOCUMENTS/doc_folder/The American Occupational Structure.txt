This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven years.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical generalizations.
