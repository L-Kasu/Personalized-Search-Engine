Since its inception Unesco has engaged in activities designed to promote the expansion and improvement of public library services as a living force for popular education and international understanding. These activities have included public library pilot projects - Colombo (Ceylon), Medellin (Colombia), Delhi (India), Abidjan (Ivory coast), Enugu (Nigeria) - training of librarians, and meetings of experts on planning library services.  It has become increasingly evident that effective public library services cannot be developed and maintained without appropriate legislation providing for a nation-wide service, offering, as far as possible, equal contract with the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), for a comparative study of existing library legislation that would be helpful to developing and developed countries alike in drafting legislation.
