This study of the UDC sets out from the assumption that both general and special documentation services can make use of a general classification.  On the other hand, it assumes that the criticisms of the UDC - the preference of some documentalists for alternative special schemes - imply that the UDC does not adequately provide the facilities currently needed.  In examining these criticisms and some special schemes an effort is made here to elucidate those features of the UDC which prevent it from being more widely used and then to suggest how the UDC might be developed to provide the facilities needed.
