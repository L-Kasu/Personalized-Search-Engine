This paper presents data for the end of 1960 on recorded use of some two hundred of the most often used scientific and medical journals in the Yale Medical Library.  The investigation was designed to identify the most abundantly used titles of recent date of publication to guide the acquisition of multiple subscriptions.  At the same time data was collected to distinguish heavily used back sets.
