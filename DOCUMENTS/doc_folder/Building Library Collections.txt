Each year thousands of books are published by the general, the technical, the governmental and the university presses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelming mass of new publications every library must, within the limit of its funds, select that small part which will be most beneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly an awesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  To the competent veteran it is a task which though carried on week after week never can approach the ease of a well mastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exercise of careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times, and scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.
