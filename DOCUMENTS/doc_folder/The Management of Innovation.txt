All the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt, some years ago, to study an industrial concern as a 'community of people at work', that is, in much the same terms one would use in a study of conduct and relationships in a village, an urban neighborhood, or a small primitive community.  This aim was never realized, because it soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked with, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which it was situated.  The wider study which then appeared necessary was not practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively, assuming its present significance only in the context of later studies.
