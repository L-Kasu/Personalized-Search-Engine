In April 1968, a group of thirty individuals from ten countries - scientists, educators, economists, humanists, industrialists, and national and international civil servants - gathered in the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.  They met at the instigation of Dr. Aurelio Peccei, an Italian industrial manager, economist, and man of vision, to discuss a subject of staggering scope - the present and future predicament of man. A series of early meetings of The Club of Rome culminated in the decision to initiate a remarkably ambitious undertaking - the Project on the Predicament of Mankind. The intent of the project is to examine the complex of problems troubling men of all nations  poverty in the midst of plenty; degradation of the environment; loss of faith in institutions; uncontrolled urban spread; insecurity of employment; alienation of youth; rejection of traditional values; and inflation and other monetary and economic disruptions.
