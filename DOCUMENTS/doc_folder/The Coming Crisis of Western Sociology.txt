The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the "hippie" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile "hassles" of intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason.
