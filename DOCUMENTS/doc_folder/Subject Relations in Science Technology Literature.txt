The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects. Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere. Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/ technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.
