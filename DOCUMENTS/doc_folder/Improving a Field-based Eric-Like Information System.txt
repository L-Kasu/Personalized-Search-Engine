This is a period for rapid growth in information systems for the sciences and professions.  Information centers are springing up across the country.  Federal agencies and private groups are both collaborating and competing to establish comprehensive systems. Changing the library's name to information center is more than linguistic faddism.  New, active roles subordinate the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver and codifier of knowledge.  Information center bears analogy to economic center and transportation center.  Like these centers, its significance is in transaction.  The significance of a transportation center lies in routes to other centers.  The significance of an information center lies in communication lines to knowledge producers and knowledge users.  Information centers are judged by their information throughput, not by their holdings.
