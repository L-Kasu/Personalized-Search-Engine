For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future.. To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are  the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials.. Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence.. The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries.. An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored.. Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost.. Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules..
