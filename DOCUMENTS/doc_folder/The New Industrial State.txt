During the fifties and sixties it had become customary to depict the economic system of the United States, along with its European and Japanese counterparts, as an accomplishment unique since the Creation.  This volume departed from the accustomed cheering.  It is my impression that the adult reader was always more skeptical than the economists of the neo-Keynesian nirvana.  Economic life was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here urge, that what was called success was less what served the individual than what served the goals of great industrial and military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding, to comprise so large a part of the economic system.  Still, who could tell that a herald of such news would be welcomed - or even heard.
