One of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of scientists.  It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the transmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, the transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the transmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process. An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the development of such a process.
