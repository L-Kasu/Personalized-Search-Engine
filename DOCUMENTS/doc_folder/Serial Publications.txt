This book has been designed as a theoretical and practical introduction to the library aspects of serial publications.  These publications are now so profuse and at the same time so significant for library purposes that librarians generally should have a good grasp of their nature and of the modes of controlling them.  Like rare books, serials give rise to frequent and sometimes intricate technicalities with which not only specialists but also head librarians, department heads, and others should be acquainted since serials are part and parcel of the workday library.
