Anything that goes under the name of production and distribution sounds as if it clearly fell into the economist's domain.  An analysis of knowledge, on the other hand, seems to be the philosopher's task, though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist.  But if one speaks of the communication of knowledge in the United States, the specialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick; also the mathematician or operations researcher specializing in communication theory and information systems may prick up his ears.  In fact, some of the knowledge to be discussed here is technological, and thus the engineer may properly be interested.  When I tried out the title of this study on representatives of various disciplines, many were rather surprised that an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind of research.
