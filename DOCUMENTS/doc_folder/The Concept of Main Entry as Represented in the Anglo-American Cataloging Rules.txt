The work published here is rather like those conclusive statements of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but in the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of the medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, the publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.
