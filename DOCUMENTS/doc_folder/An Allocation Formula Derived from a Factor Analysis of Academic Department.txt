The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables in that factor..
