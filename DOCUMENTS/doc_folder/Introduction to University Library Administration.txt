The last ten years have witnessed the growth of an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race. All this has changed  as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls. He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change  universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.
