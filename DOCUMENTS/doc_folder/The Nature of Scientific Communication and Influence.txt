As the formal communication system of science has become less able to supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are scientific publications utilized by scientists  What is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis  How does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes  Three types of studies have been conducted in this area  (a) studies of the scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..
