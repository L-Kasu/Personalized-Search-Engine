A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may consist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their relative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are presented.. Information, retrieval, clustering, index terms, semantic, graphs, clusters, associations, synonyms, subgraphs, complete, maximal, connected, component, relevance measure, vocabulary, indexing systems, cliques..
