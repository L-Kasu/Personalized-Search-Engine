Most discussions about the future design of chemical information systems emphasize the effects of computer speed on composition, storage, searching, and retrieval.  Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective compression.
