In 1955 the Publications Committee of the Library Association approached my chief, Mr. A.J. Wells, with a request that he should write a book on subject cataloguing.  At the time, Mr. Wells was preoccupied with the inauguration of the British National Bibliography Card Service, and he made the suggestion, which was agreed by the Committee, that I should undertake the task.  The result is scarcely an adequate substitute for the book which Mr. Wells would have written. Nevertheless, he has had a major part in shaping my views on subject cataloguing, and in this sense the present book stems back to him, though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward.
