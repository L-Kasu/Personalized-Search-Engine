As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justified precisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  For two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.
