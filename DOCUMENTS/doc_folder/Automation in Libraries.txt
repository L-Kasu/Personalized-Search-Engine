My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing, periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.
