This paper is not an official policy statement of the American Library Association nor of the Office for Library Education.  It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective. A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call "professional."
