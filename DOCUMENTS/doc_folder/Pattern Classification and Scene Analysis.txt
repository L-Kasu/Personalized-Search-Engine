Our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account of major topics in pattern recognition, a field concerned with machine recognition of meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments. The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the subject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors. Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these vector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead, every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its special characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain has received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area has progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description. Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics in visual scene analysis.
