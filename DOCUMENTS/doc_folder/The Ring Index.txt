The collection includes (1) simple parent rings and (2) parent systems of more than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atoms in common.  It thus comparizes simple and fused (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds).  The word system is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both. Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query ( ) is inserted after the reference.
