The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors: (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an international scale. (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years. The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of research materials as well.
