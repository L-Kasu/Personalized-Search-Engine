This book describes some of the various ways in which a computer could be used as part of a library system.  In doing so, it aims to bridge the gap between librarian and computer specialist, by introducing computers to those involved in library work, especially students of librarianship, and at the same time helping to make those interested in the computer applications field aware of the potential and problems of the library environment.
