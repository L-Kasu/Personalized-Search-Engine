Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual, machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems.. Cost factors are not discussed..
