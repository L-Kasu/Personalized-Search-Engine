This paper is developed in two stages.  The first stage describes an experiment that explores properties of the class of words that are not useful in conveying subject meaning and distinguishes them from those classes of words that do convey subject meaning to various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering properties of these words; the analysis is based on statistical properties alone, and techniques are introduced that may be of value in other areas of information science.  On the basis of the results of this experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply this model to indexing.
