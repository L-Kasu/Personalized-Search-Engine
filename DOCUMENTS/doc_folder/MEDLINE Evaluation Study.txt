MEDLINE (MEDLARS-ON-LINE) is the new on-line, interactive bibliographic searching system which was recently developed by the National Library of Medicine.. The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citations and other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedical journals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by 246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed some reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with the imposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline..
