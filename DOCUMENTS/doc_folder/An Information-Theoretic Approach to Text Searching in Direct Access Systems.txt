Using direct access computer files of bibliographic information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only infrequently. A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages.
