At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition requesting the collection and publication of medical school library statistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of the Medical Library Association. This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself, studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961). After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J. Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges.
