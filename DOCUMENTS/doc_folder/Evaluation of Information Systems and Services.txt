This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken  to outline in some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been attempted.
