When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not really summarize the findings of the study in one evening. The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine libraries.
