The key question was whether restrictions are being imposed on librarians, or whether they are imposing restrictions on themselves, that threaten the citizen's right to easy access to as adequate a collection of books and periodicals as his community, his country or his state can afford.  Readers of this report may come to different conclusions about the "right" answer to this question, but whether they conclude that librarians are or are not being as forceful as they might be in developing and upholding freedom-to-read principles, it should not be forgotten that it is librarians themselves who have had the courage to provide the evidence.
