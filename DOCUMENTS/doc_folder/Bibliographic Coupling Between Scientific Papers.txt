This report describes the results of automatic processing of a large number of scientific papers according to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The population of papers under study was ordered into groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation. An examination of the papers that constitute the groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.
