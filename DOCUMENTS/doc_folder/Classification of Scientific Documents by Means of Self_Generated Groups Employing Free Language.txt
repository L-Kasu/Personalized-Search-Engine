A study was undertaken to classify mechanically a document collection using the free-language words in the titles and abstracts of a corpus of 261 physics research papers.. Using a clustering algorithm, results were obtained which closely duplicated the clusters obtained by previous experiments with citations.. A brief comparison is made with a traditional manual classification system.. It is shown that the mechanical procedure is capable of achieving simultaneous average relevance and recall figures above 80%..
