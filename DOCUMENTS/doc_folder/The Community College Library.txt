This study deals with the learning resources programs of the public two-year colleges.  In former years, these institutions were commonly called junior colleges, and the college departments or divisions that assembled, organized, and interpreted the learning resources (mainly books) were commonly called libraries.  In keeping with traditional terminology I could have chosen "The Junior College Library" as the title for the study; however, I decided to modify the title to make it correspond more closely to prevailing current terminology.
