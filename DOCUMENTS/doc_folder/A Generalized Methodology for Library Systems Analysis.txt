This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however, will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming, simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.
