Kuhn's concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed as technologies involving degree of task predictability.. A series of hypotheses were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields.. Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines..
