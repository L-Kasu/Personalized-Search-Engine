The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information "utilities." These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the "make versus buy" issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.
