This book is an introduction to the field of information science and technology, with particular emphasis on document organization. Its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with types of problems rather than particular systems.  When particular systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather than as models. The method of presentation is expository at the introductory level.  While differing points of view are frequently noted, this book is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation.  Relevant research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities in the field.
