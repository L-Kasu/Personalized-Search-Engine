Pattern recognition has been introduced to the chemical literature as a general tool which can be used by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to relevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, it provides connections between raw, multivariant data and sought-for information without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data. The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given a collection of objects and a list of measurements made on each object, is it possible to find and or predict a property of the objects that is not directly measurable but is known to be related to the measurements via some unknown relationship   The only assumption made is that similarities and dissimilarities among objects are reflected in at least some of the measurements.
