This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact with the Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as a classification teacher.  As a Information Officer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, I was concerned with the use of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), both as classifier and as user of the resulting catalogues; I was also directly concerned as Liaison Officer for the Atomic Energy Research committee for UDC with the development of the Code of Practice which later became the basis of the Special subject edition for nuclear science and engineering.  With accelerators; this work was carried out along the general lines indicated in this study, and is now part of UDC, which indicates that modern ideas can be accommodated within the scheme without undue strain.
