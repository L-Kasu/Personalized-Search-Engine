For Popper, science is the very epitome of objective knowledge.  The central papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says  All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective knowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objective knowledge as masons work on a cathedral. I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'. This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third, I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is seriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transforming Popper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformative method' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makes knowledge objective.
