LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business, industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of many computer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in a customized form.. Each different application required a different package, with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages were developed via suitable modification of modular system software to result in products tailored to user idiosyncracies.. The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures, and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line, interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users.. Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing upon cost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed..
