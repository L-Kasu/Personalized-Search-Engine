This volume is intended as a means of exploration for the practicing librarian and as a textbook for the library school student.  It will try to draw attention to significant social, behavioral, theoretical, organizational, functional, and operational generalizations about library interrelationships; and to suggest a sense of the total fabric of the cooperative endeavor.  It does not aim at identifying and incorporating the forms and the range of library cooperation in which individual libraries seek to extend the limits of their separate capabilities.
