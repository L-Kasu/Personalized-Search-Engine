This paper reports correlates of departmental prestige (American Council on Education rating of the quality of graduate faculty, 1966) for a sample of 125 departments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.. The analysis mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It is shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding variables are held constant..
