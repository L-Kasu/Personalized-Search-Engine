An individual correlation is a correlation in which the statistical object or thing described is indivisible.  The correlation between color and illiteracy for persons in the United States, shown later in Table 1, is an individual correlation, because the kind of thing described is an indivisible unit, a person.  In an individual correlation the variables are descriptive properties of individuals, such as height, income, eye color, or race, and not descriptive statistical constants such as rates or means. In an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons.  The correlation between the percentage of the population which is Negro and the percentage of the population which is illiterate for the 48 states, shown later as Figure 2, is an ecological correlation.  The thing described is the population of a state, and not a single individual.  The variables are percentages, descriptive properties of groups, and not descriptive properties of individuals.
