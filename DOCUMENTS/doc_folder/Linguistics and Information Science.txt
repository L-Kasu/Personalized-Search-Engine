This study was commissioned by the Committee on Linguistics in Documentation of the Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID). It is concerned with the linguistic aspects of information science, and in particular with the linguistic components of document analysis, description, and retrieval.  We have attempted to relate linguistics and information science by considering the theories and techniques linguistics has to offer, and how far these have been, or could be, exploited by information scientists.  We have examined these questions within the context of automated language processing and automated documentation.  The use of computers for linguistic operations presents special challenges as well as interesting possibilities, and we have chosen to approach the field from this particular point of view.
