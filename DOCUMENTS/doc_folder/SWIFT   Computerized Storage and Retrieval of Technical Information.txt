A unique method of computerized storage and retrieval of technical information is applied in the SWIFT (Significant Word in Full Title) program.  SWIFT chooses potential keywords from the titles, compares the key words with an exclusion word glossary to remove insignificant words and an internal glossary to prevent duplication of terms.  The keywords may be either a full or fragmented term. An option is available to index also by author.  Indexes, containing full citations, are printed periodically and cumulatively.  The magnetic tape file is available for computer search through a sort and print program.  Responses to inquiries conducted through the computer program are listed in full citation format.
