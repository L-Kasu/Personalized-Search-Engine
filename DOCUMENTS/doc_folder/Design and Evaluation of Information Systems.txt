The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and "evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products.
