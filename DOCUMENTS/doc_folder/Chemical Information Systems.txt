The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature searching and information storage and organization.
