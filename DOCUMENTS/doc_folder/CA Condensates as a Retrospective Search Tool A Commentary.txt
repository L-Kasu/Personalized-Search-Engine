A retrospective test search on 1 year of CA Condensates was carried out in order to calculate the cost per profile and to get an impression of how CA Condensates would suffice as a database for a retrospective use.. Some means of improving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format were investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts presently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large free-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios generally observed for free text databases and the very high number of references of potential interest retrieved..
