The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E. Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader in bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectures were published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitly recognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on the history of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of the processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production of literature to international developments).
