A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968, librarians made a rare examination of their own literature and considered this gap and other information problems in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic Control of Library Science Literature recommended the establishment of a fast announcement service for library schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index serving the whole range of information-oriented professions was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference group to meet the need for current information (2).
