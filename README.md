# Personalized-Search-Engine
## Overview
### The UI
To start the search engine run the [executable file](https://github.com/L-Kasu/Personalized-Search-Engine/blob/main/executable.py).  
In the UI you can choose a file you want to search in. 
You can choose between several color schemes and languages.  
The System searches in txt- and PDF-documents.  

### The search engine  
You have the choice between different searching alorithms:
- tf-idf
- word embedding  

For every searching algortihm you can used it with or without clustering.  

### The evaluation
The evaluation is executed in the [main file](https://github.com/L-Kasu/Personalized-Search-Engine/blob/main/main.py).  
The file will guide through the evaluation in the Terminal.  
You can evaluate the searching-algorithms and compare two algorithms.  
In the evaluation the mean-average-precission and the f1-score is computed. 
For the evaluation the [CISI dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dmaso01dsta/cisi-a-dataset-for-information-retrieval) is used.
