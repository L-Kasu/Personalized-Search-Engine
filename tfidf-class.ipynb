The \"classification\" phase matches each word of a document title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristic techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification phase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence the section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance and human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.

They focus on understanding and improving the decision process; a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving them access to analytic models.  The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to situations where a \"final\" system can be developed only through an adaptive process of learning and evolution.

Each of the eight models is a special case of the general formulation and is one of five types of formulation.  In order to estimate three unknown parameters, a statistical method using root-weighted square error is proposed.  A comparative experiment using 11 databases suggests that the fifth type of formulation with three unknown parameters is the best fit to the observed data.

This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, and experimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented natural language understanding system developed and presently running at the Milan Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a two level modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility and generality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitate the exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects. The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of the single segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor, legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing (enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple, incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in detail.

The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.\",\n",

Six pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a \"general social indicators\" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators (SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic in nature.  As expected, they were relatively \"harder\" than the first group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked through citations in certain papers.

The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returned in an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously. The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall simultaneously.

The high level of investment in factories and plants and the ever-increasing fight to improve productivity by automating the dull, routine jobs are usually quoted and compared with the extremely low investment in improving and automating the equally tedious routine jobs in the office environment; the investment in the factory is quoted as being ten times greater per employee than in the office.  This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard, forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their office operations.',\n",
