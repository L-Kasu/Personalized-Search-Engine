       "'2g1G. u5F g2 From Eqs. ~11! and ~12!, it can be seen that Ru50, which means that the vector u ~containing the two impulse re- sponses! is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix R cor- responding to the eigenvalue 0. Moreover, if the two impulse responses g1 and g2 have no common zeros and the autocor- relation matrix of the source signal s(n) is full rank, which is assumed in the rest of this paper, the covariance matrix R has one and only one eigenvalue equal to 0.20 In practice, accurate estimation of the vector u is not trivial, because of the nature of speech, the length of the impulse responses, the background noise, etc. However, for this application we only need to ﬁnd an efﬁcient way to detect the direct paths of the two impulse responses. In the following, it is explained how this can be done. B. Adaptive algorithm In practice, it is simple to estimate iteratively the eigen- vector ~here u! corresponding to the minimum ~or maxi- mum! eigenvalue of R, by using an algorithm similar to the Frost algorithm which is a simple constrained Least-Mean- Square ~LMS!,21 or by using the algorithms proposed in Ref. 22. In the following, we show how to apply these techniques to our problem. Minimizing the quantity uTRu with respect to u and subject to iui 25uTu51 will give us the optimum ﬁlter weights uopt . Let us deﬁne the error signal: e~n !5 uT~n !x~n ! iu~n !i , ~14! T(n) where x(n)5@x1 T(n)# T. Note that minimizing the x2 mean square value of e(n) is equivalent to solving the above eigenvalue problem. Taking the gradient of e(n) with re- spect to u(n) gives which is what is desired: the eigenvector u(`) correspond- ing to the smallest eigenvalue E$e 2(n)% of the covariance matrix R. In practice, it is advantageous to use the following ad- aptation scheme to avoid roundoff error propagation:23 u~n !2me~n !¹e~n ! iu~n !2me~n !¹e~n !i u~n11 !5 . ~19! Note that if this trick is used, then iu(n)i @which appears in e(n) and ¹e(n)# can be removed, since we will always have iu(n)i51. C. A simpliﬁed algorithm The algorithm Eq. ~19! presented above is a little bit complicated and is very general to ﬁnd the eigenvector cor- responding to the smallest eigenvalue of any matrix R. If the smallest eigenvalue is equal to zero, which is the case here, the algorithm can be simpliﬁed as follows: e~n !5uT~n !x~n ! and u~n11 !5 u~n !2me~n !x~n ! iu~n !2me~n !x~n !i . ~20! ~21! Note that this algorithm can be seen as an approximation of the previous one by neglecting the terms in e 2(n) @in Eq. ~19!#, which is reasonable ~since the smallest eigenvalue is equal to zero!. In this application, the two algorithms Eqs. ~19! and ~21! should have the same performance after con- vergence even with low SNRs. Moreover, in all experiments the ﬁlter ~UFLMS!24 is used to implement the impulse response esti- mation algorithm. Note that this algorithm is still efﬁcient from a complexity point of view but it requires seven FFT operations per block ~because we need to go back to the time-domain to apply the norm constraint!, while the PHAT requires only three FFT operations per block. frequency-domain unconstrained adaptive ¹e~n !5 1 iu~n !iF x~n !2e~n ! u~n ! iu~n !iG , ~15! D. Discussion and we obtain the gradient-descent constrained LMS algo- rithm: u~n11 !5u~n !2me~n !¹e~n !, ~16! where m, the adaptation step, is a positive constant. Substituting Eqs. ~14! and ~15! into Eq. ~16! gives u~n11 !5u~n ! 2 m iu~n !iF x~n !xT~n ! u~n ! iu~n !i 2e 2~n ! u~n ! iu~n !iG and taking mathematical expectation after convergence, we get R u~` ! iu~` !i 5E$e 2~n !% u~` ! iu~` !i , ~17! ~18! The goal here is not to accurately estimate the two im- pulse responses g 1 and g 2 but rather the time-delay. For that, we need to detect the two direct paths. Thus initialization of the proposed algorithm is a key issue. During adaptation, the ﬁrst half of vector u will contain an estimate of the impulse response g 2 ; initializing by 1 ~at time n50! a tap of u some- where in the middle of the ﬁrst half part ~in order to take into account negative and positive relative delays!, say u M /2(0) 51, and adjusting the parameters of the adaptive algorithm ~which is easy to do! in such a way that this ~positive! peak will always be dominant ~during adaptation! in comparison with the M 21 other taps of the ﬁrst half of u, u M /2(n) will be considered an estimate of the direct path of g 2 . A ‘‘mir- ror’’ effect will appear in the second half of u ~containing an estimation of the impulse response 2g 1!: a negative peak will dominate and that will be an estimation of the direct path of 2g 1 . Thus the relative delay will simply be the difference between the indices corresponding to these two 386 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 107, No. 1, January 2000 Jacob Benesty: Adaptive eigenvalue 386 '"
